ES (Enginsoft) plugin

This plugin contains a solver that calculates the surface and volume of a cone. 
The cone is described by two parameters, radius and height, that are written in
the data.txt file.
The results are written in the data_out.txt file.

This implementation is a "toy" model for executing the prototype for 
modeFRONTIER optimization.
